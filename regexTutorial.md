# Regex Tutorial

This Regex (Regular Expression) tutorial is created to help you understand and define the sequence of special characters to verify a search term. A Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also used frequently to validate input data.

## Summary

Today I will be covering and breaking down the components of a regular expression used to match Hex Values. Hex values are commonly used for color using the hexadecimal color code format. In the web we can use hex triplet (hex color code) to represent colors on a web page. For the hex color code, there are two formats, a standard hex triplet and a shorthand hex format, where both formats start with a #./^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
